# Day-1---Band-Name-Generator-Project

A fun Python beginner project that asks for user input and generates a fictional band name by combining a city and pet name.

## What I Learned
- `input()` function and handling user input
- Basic string formatting and concatenation
- Writing clean, readable code with print statements

## How to Run

Clone the repo and run:
python task.py

```python
print("Welcome to The Band Name Generator!")
city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\nAnswer: ")
pet = input("What is the name of a pet of yours?\nAnswer: ")
print("Your band name could be: " + city + " " + pet)
